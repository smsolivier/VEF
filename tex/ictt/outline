Background 
	old method for nonlinear acceleration 
	description of 2 solutions 
	new application for different discretizations 

Motivation 
	DG is used in SN 
	consistent diffusion must be expressed in P1 form 
		much more difficult to solve 
	VEF drift diffusion can be any valid discretization 
		no concern for consistency needed 
	VEF drift diffusion is conservative 
	multiphysics 
		conservative 
		use discretization beneficial for other physics components 

Purpose
	investigate VEF for 1D, one group, LLDG/MFEM neutron transport 
	MFEM is being used for high order hydrodynamics 
		MFEM is inapropriate for standard form of TE 

Description of VEF Method 
	show TE 
	apply SN
	setup SI 
	show VEF drift diffusion equation 
	definition of VEF 
	flowchart of algorithm 
	hypothesis for acceleration 
		eddington converges faster 
		inclusion of scattering 

LLDG (provide background to understand slope reconstruction)
	diagram of basis functions 
	upwinding for cell edge eddington 
	within cell eddington formula 

MFEM 
	diagram of basis functions 
	identical grid 
	weak form of equations 
	apply 
		eliminate J 
		continuity of current 
		phi_i-1/2 = phi_(i-1)+1/2
	description of global unknowns 
	boundary conditions from QD 
	solution from banded matrix of center and edge fluxes 

Scattering update methods 
	clearly define names of methods 
	diagram of slope reconstruction methods 
		flat update 
		linear 
		edge reconstruction? 
	temperature equation will not have edges (no continuity of T)
	van leer limiting 
		monotonicity 

Computational Results 
	iterative convergence transfer 
		eddington does converge faster 
	comparison to SI and S2SA 
		as effective 
	MMS setup (full but skip if low on time)
		increased accuracy from slope reconstruction 
		same order of accuracy 
		2nd order method 
	solution convergence 
		be clear about iterative v solution 
		homogeneous and reeds problem
			show solutions to highlight discontinuities 
		2nd order convergence between solutions 
		explanation for loss of increased convergence for reed 
	Diffusion limit 
		cross section scaling 
		works for both update method 

Conclusions 
	reiterate comp results 
		as effective as S2SA
		2nd order accurate 
		preservation of thick diffusion limit 
		scattering reconstruction good 
	2 solutions is small price to pay for discretization versatility 
		built in measure of truncation error (naturally provided)

Future Work 
	2/3D 
	Radiative Transfer
		teleportation effect of unresolved temperature grid 
	high order finite elements 
	adapt for k eig calculations
