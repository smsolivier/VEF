We apply the Variable Eddington Factor (VEF) acceleration method to the 1-D, one-group \SN equations with a Lumped 
Linear Discontinuous Galerkin (LLDG) spatial discretization in conjunction with a drift-diffusion acceleration 
equation discretized with the constant-linear Mixed Finite-Element Method (MFEM).  While the VEF method is quite old, 
its application to this particular combination of \SN and drift-diffusion discretizations is new.  In addition to 
demonstrating the basic properties of our method, we investigate slope reconstruction techniques for improving the 
consistency between the \SN and drift-diffusion solutions.
