R1
1. cited Raviart Thomas when MFEM is introduced 

3. they were asking about why Eq. 1 is partial but Eq. 2 is "total" derivative. Equation 1 is partial since psi is a function of x and mu while Eq. 2 is just a function of x. They also might be confused by the use of an upright d instead of a slanted one. Should I switch to slanted for all the regular derivatives? 

R2 
1. added Goldin and Mihalas in the introduction as old methods 

2. Not sure how to reference in the introduction. Add a line about other pairings? 

3. Where to put hybrid MC/VEF method reference
