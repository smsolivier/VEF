Motivation
	why work is needed (importance/difficulties)

Sn/SI background 

Eddington Acceleration  
	Moment equations 

	Explain algorithm 
		flow chart ? 

Results
	describe test problem 
	solution comparison of all methods (MC?) 
	convergence comparison to unaccelerated and S2SA 
	convergence rate comparison 
		push fast convergence to phi 

Future Work 

	Develop rad hydro algorithm that makes use of drift diffusion solve 

	energy discretization 

	higher dimensions 

Extra Slides 
	
	LD recovery schemes
