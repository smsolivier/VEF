We present the Variable Eddington Factor (VEF) method, a non-linear Discrete Ordinates Source Iteration scheme that relaxes the consistency requirement of the transport and acceleration steps' spatial discretization. The method was applied to the 1-D, one-group neutron transport equation with Lumped Linear Discontinuous Galerkin (LLDG) transport and the constant-linear Mixed Finite Element Method (MFEM) drift diffusion acceleration. Methods for increased consistency between the transport and acceleration steps are also presented. The VEF method exhibited second-order convergence as expected from the orders of accuracy of LLDG and MFEM in isolation, accelerated source iterations as well as consistently differenced S$_2$SA, and survived the thick diffusion limit. In addition, the difference between the transport and acceleration steps' solution was shown to converge as the mesh was refined.
