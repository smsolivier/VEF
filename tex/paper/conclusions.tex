\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
We have presented the VEF method for one-group neutron transport in slab geometry and the pairing of Lumped Linear Discontinuous Galerkin for the \SN transport step and the constant-linear Mixed Finite-Element Method for the drift diffusion acceleration step. We have numerically demonstrated that the LLDG/MFEM VEF method accelerates Source Iteration by transferring the rapid convergence of the angular shape of the angular flux to the scalar flux. In addition, the VEF method performed similarly to consistently differenced S$_2$SA. 

Methods for increased consistency between LLDG and MFEM were also presented. This included a cell-centered slope reconstruction for constructing a linear scalar flux dependence from the drift-diffusion solution. It was shown that both the VEF methods with and without added consistency measures were second-order accurate as expected from the orders of accuracy of LLDG and MFEM in isolation and that all of the VEF methods were robust in the diffusion limit. In addition, while this nonlinear scheme produces two solutions, the \SN and drift-diffusion solutions were shown to converge as the mesh was refined for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous systems. Furthermore, the drift-diffusion solutions for the scalar flux and current are conservative and much less expensive and thus are the preferred solutions to compute quantities of interest. In addition, the \SN and VEF drift-diffusion equations can be discretized with arbitrarily different methods allowing the drift-diffusion discretization to match that of the other multiphysics components without degraded source iteration acceleration.
