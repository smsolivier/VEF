\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
We have presented the VEF method for one-group neutron transport in slab geometry and the application of LLDG to the \SN equations and MFEM to the VEF drift diffusion equations. We have numerically demonstrated that the LLDG/MFEM VEF method accelerates Source Iteration by transferring the rapid convergence of the angular shape of the angular flux to the scalar flux. The VEF method performed similarly to consistently differenced S$_2$SA. 

Methods for increased consistency between LLDG and MFEM were also presented. This included a cell centered slope reconstruction method that will be needed for radiative transfer calculations. It was shown that that all the VEF methods were second-order as expected from the orders of accuracy of LLDG and MFEM in isolation and that the inconsistent, partially consistent, and fully consistent VEF methods were robust in the diffusion limit. In addition, while this nonlinear scheme produces two solutions, one from \SN and one from drift diffusion, the solutions were shown to converge as the mesh was refined for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous systems. 

Future work includes extending the VEF method presented in this paper to the radiative transfer equations and verifying the VEF method in 2 and 3 dimensional systems.
