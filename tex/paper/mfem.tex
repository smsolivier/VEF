	\label{fig:mfem_grid}
\end{figure}
We apply the MFEM method to Eqs.~\ref{eq:zero} and \ref{eq:first}, and then eliminate the currents to obtain a discretization for Eq.~\ref{eq:drift}.  In this 
method, different basis functions are used for each of the two variables. The unknowns in an MFEM cell are depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:mfem_grid}. The scalar flux is constant within the cell with discontinuous jumps at the cell edges and the current is a linear function defined by: 
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:MFEM_current}
		J_i(x) = J_{i,L} B_{i,L}(x) + J_{i,R} B_{R,i}(x) \,, 
	\end{equation} 
where $J_{i,L/R}$ are the currents at the left and right edges of the cell and 
	\begin{subequations}
		\begin{equation}
			B_{i,L}(x) = \begin{cases}
				\frac{x_{i+1/2} - x}{h_i} \,, & x \in [x_{i-1/2}, x_{i+1/2}] \\ 
				0 \,, & \text{otherwise}
			\end{cases} \,,
		\end{equation}
		\begin{equation}
			B_{i,R}(x) = \begin{cases}
				\frac{x - x_{i-1/2}}{h_i} \,, & x \in [x_{i-1/2}, x_{i+1/2}] \\ 
				0 \,, & \text{otherwise}
			\end{cases} \,,
		\end{equation}
	\end{subequations}
are the MFEM basis functions. The constant-linear MFEM yields second order accuracy for both the scalar flux and the current. The spatial grid used in this step is identical to the grid used in the LLDG \SN step. 

The MFEM representation yields five unknowns per cell: $\phi_{i-1/2}$, $\phi_i$, $\phi_{i+1/2}$, $J_{i,L}$, and $J_{i,R}$. However, 
each edge flux on the mesh interior is shared by two cells, so with $I$ cells there are $I$ cell-center scalar fluxes, $2I$ currents, 
and $2I-1$ interior-mesh cell-edge scalar fluxes, and 2 boundary cell-edge scalar fluxes. An equation for $\phi_i$ is found by integrating Eq.~\ref{eq:zero} over cell $i$: 
	\begin{equation} \label{mfem:balance}
		J_{i,R} - J_{i,L} + \sigma_{a,i} h_i \phi_i = Q_i h_i \,,
	\end{equation}
where $\sigma_{a,i}$ and $Q_i$ are the absorption cross section and source in cell $i$. Equations for $J_{i,L/R}$ are found by multiplying Eq.~\ref{eq:first} by $B_{i,L/R}$ and integrating over cell $i$: 
	\begin{subequations}
		\begin{equation} \label{mfem:bli}
			-\edd_{i-1/2} \phi_{i-1/2} + \edd_i \phi_i + \sigma_{t,i} h_i \left(\frac{1}{3} J_{i,L} + \frac{1}{6}J_{i,R}\right) = 0 \,,
		\end{equation}
		\begin{equation} \label{mfem:bri}
			\edd_{i+1/2} \phi_{i+1/2} - \edd_i \phi_i + \sigma_{t,i} h_i \left(\frac{1}{6} J_{i,L} + \frac{1}{3} J_{i,R}\right) = 0 \,, 
		\end{equation}
	\end{subequations}
where the fixed source has been assumed to be isotropic. The Eddington factors, $\edd_{i(\pm1/2)}$, are computed with Eq.~\ref{lldg:edd} using the angular fluxes from the LLDG \SN step. 
Eliminating $J_{i,R}$ from Eq.~\ref{mfem:bli} and $J_{i,L}$ from Eq.~\ref{mfem:bri} yields: 
	\begin{subequations}
		\begin{equation} \label{mfem:jli}
			J_{i,L} = \frac{-2}{\sigma_{t,i} h_i} \bigg\{
				2\br{\eddphi{i} - \eddphi{i-1/2}}
				- \br{\eddphi{i+1/2} - \eddphi{i}}
			\bigg\} \,,
		\end{equation}
		\begin{equation} \label{mfem:jri}
			J_{i,R} = \frac{-2}{\sigma_{t,i} h_i} \bigg\{
				2\br{\eddphi{i+1/2} - \eddphi{i}} 
				- \br{\eddphi{i} - \eddphi{i-1/2}}
			\bigg\} \,.
		\end{equation}
	\end{subequations}
An equation for $\phi_{i+1/2}$ on the mesh interior is found by enforcing continuity of current at the cell edges: 
	\begin{equation} \label{mfem:continuity}
		J_{i,R} = J_{i+1, L} \,. 
	\end{equation}

Using the definitions of $J_{i,L}$ and $J_{i,R}$ from Eqs.~\ref{mfem:jli} and \ref{mfem:jri} in the balance equation (Eq.~\ref{mfem:balance}) and continuity equation (Eq.~\ref{mfem:continuity}) yields equations for all cell-center fluxes and 
interior-mesh cell-edge fluxes.  The resulting balance and continuity equations are:
	\begin{subequations}
		\begin{equation} \label{mfem:center}
			-\frac{6}{\sigma_{t,i}h_i} \edd_{i-1/2} \phi_{i-1/2}
			+ \left(\frac{12}{\sigma_{t,i}h_i} \edd_i + \sigma_{a,i} h_i\right) \phi_i 
			- \frac{6}{\sigma_{t,i} h_i} \edd_{i+1/2} \phi_{i+1/2} 
			= Q_i h_i \,,
		\end{equation}
		\begin{multline} \label{mfem:edge}
			-\ALPHA{2}{i} \eddphi{i-1/2} + \ALPHA{6}{i} \eddphi{i} 
			- 4\paren{\ALPHA{1}{i} + \ALPHA{1}{i+1}} \eddphi{i+1/2} \\
			+ \ALPHA{6}{i+1}\eddphi{i+1} 
			- \ALPHA{2}{i+1} \eddphi{i+3/2}
			= 0 \,. 
		\end{multline}
	\end{subequations}
The equations for the outer boundary fluxes, $\phi_{1/2}$ and $\phi_{I+1/2}$, involve boundary conditions together with continuity conditions.  For instance,
the equation for $\phi_{1/2}$ is 
\begin{equation}
		J_{1,L} = J_{1/2} \,,
\end{equation}		
where $J_{1,L}$ is defined in Eq.~\ref{mfem:jli}, and $J_{1/2}$ is the left boundary current defined by a boundary condition.  For a reflective condition,
\begin{equation}
    J_{1/2} = 0 \, .
\end{equation}
For a source condition,
\begin{equation}
		J_{1/2} = 2 \sum_{\mu_n>0} \mu_n \psi_{n,1/2} w_n - B_{1/2} \phi_{1/2} \,,
\end{equation}  
 where  
\begin{equation}
		B_{1/2} = \frac{\sum_{n=1}^N |\mu_n| \psi_{n,1/2} w_n}{
			\sum_{n=1}^N \psi_{n,1/2} w_n 
		} 
\end{equation}
is the boundary Eddington factor \cite{QDBC}.  The equation for  $\phi_{I+1/2}$ is 
\begin{equation}
		J_{I,R} = J_{I+1/2} \, .
\end{equation}		
where $J_{I,R}$ is defined in Eq.~\ref{mfem:jri}, and $J_{I+1/2}$ is the right boundary current.  For a reflective condition,
\begin{equation}
    J_{I+1/2} = 0 \, .
\end{equation}
For a source condition,
\begin{equation}
		J_{I+1/2} = B_{I+1/2} \phi_{I+1/2} - 2 \sum_{\mu_n<0} |\mu_n| \psi_{n,I+1/2} w_n  \,,
\end{equation}  
where 
\begin{equation}
		B_{I+1/2} = \frac{\sum_{n=1}^N |\mu_n| \psi_{n,I+1/2} w_n}{
			\sum_{n=1}^N \psi_{n,I+1/2} w_n 
		} \, .
\end{equation}

These transport-consistent, Marshak-like source boundary conditions are derived starting with the identity
\begin{equation}
J=j^+ - j^- \,,
\end{equation}
where $j^\pm$ denotes the positive half-range currents associated with $\mu >0$ and $\mu <0$, respectively.  For the left boundary condition, 
we simply perform the following algebraic manipulations:
\begin{equation}
J = j^+ - j^-  = 2j^+ - (j^+ + j^-) = 2j^+ - \frac{j^+ + j^-}{\phi} \phi \, .
\end{equation}
For the right boundary condition, we similarly obtain
\begin{equation}
J = j^+ - j^-  = (j^+ + j^-) - 2j^- = \frac{j^+ + j^-}{\phi} \phi - 2j^-\, .
\end{equation}
Note that these source boundary conditions become equivalent to the standard Marshak boundary conditions if the \SN angular flux 
is isotropic. 
The system of $2I+1$ equations for the cell-center and cell-edge fluxes can be assembled into a matrix of both cell-centered and cell-edge scalar fluxes and solved with a banded matrix solver of bandwidth five. 

% Applying the MFEM to Eqs.~\ref{eq:zero} and \ref{eq:first} and enforcing continuity of current yields: 
% 	\begin{subequations} \label{eq:mfem}
	
% 	\begin{multline}
% 		-\frac{2}{\sigma_{t,i} h_i} \edd_{i-1/2}\phi_{i-1/2} + 
% 		\frac{6}{\sigma_{t,i} h_i} \edd_i \phi_i

% 		- \frac{2}{\sigma_{t,i+1} h_{i+1}} \edd_{i+3/2} \phi_{i+3/2} 
% 		= 0 \,,
% 	\end{multline}
% 	\end{subequations}
% where the Eddington factor is evaluated at iteration $\ell+1/2$ and the scalar flux at $\ell+1$. 
% Here, the Eddington factor has been assumed to be constant in each cell with discontinuous jumps at the edges. 
% The simplest method of converting the Eddington factor from LLDG to MFEM is to compute the Eddington factor using the cell centered and cell edged angular fluxes using Eqs.~\ref{eq:lldg_i}, \ref{eq:downwind}, and \ref{eq:upwind}. A more consistent way to transfer the Eddington factor is to represent the LLDG angular flux as a linear function using the MFEM basis functions: 
% 	\begin{equation} \label{eq:eddquad}
% 		\edd_i(x) = \frac{
% 			\sum_{n=1}^N \mu_n^2 \left[\psi_{n,i,L}B_{i,L}(x) + \psi_{n,i,R} B_{i,R}(x)\right]
% 		}
% 		{
% 			B_{i,L}(x) \sum_{n=1}^N w_n \psi_{n,i,L} + B_{i,R}(x) \sum_{n=1}^N w_n \psi_{n,i,R} 
% 		} \,,
% 	\end{equation}
% where 
	
% and 

% When MFEM is applied, the integral over cell $i$ of the rational polynomial given in Eq.~\ref{eq:eddquad} is approximated with 2 point Gauss quadrature. The cell centered Eddington factors used in Eq.~\ref{eq:mfem} are then: 
% 	\begin{equation} 
% 		\edd_i = \half \left[ \edd_i(x_{i,L}) + \edd_i(x_{i,R}) \right] \,,
% 	\end{equation}
% where 
% 	\begin{equation}
% 		x_{i,L/R} = \frac{x_{i+1/2} - x_{i-1/2}}{2} \mp \frac{x_{i+1/2} + x_{i-1/2}}{2\sqrt{3}}
% 	\end{equation}
% are the quadrature points in cell $i$. 

% Transport consistent vacuum boundary conditions are applied through a modified Marshak boundary condition: 
% 	\begin{equation} 
% 		J(x) = B(x) \phi(x) \,,
% 	\end{equation} 
% where 
% 	\begin{equation} 
% 		B(x) = \frac{\int_{-1}^1 |\mu| \psi(x, \mu) \ud \mu}
% 		{\int_{-1}^1 \psi(x, \mu) \ud \mu} \,. 
% 	\end{equation}

\subsection{Increased Consistency Between LLDG and MFEM}
The \SN solution provides the drift-diffusion equation with the variable Eddington factor, and the drift-diffusion solution provides the \SN  
equations with the scalar flux used to construct the scattering term.  One can simply assume a constant dependence for the variable 
Eddington factor within each cell, as defined in Eq.~\ref{lldg:edd}.  However, the LLDG discretization provides the following form for the 
variable Eddington factor on the interior of each mesh cell:
	\begin{equation} \label{mfem:ldconsistent}
		\edd_i(x) = \frac{
			\sum_{n=1}^N \mu_n^2 \left[\psi_{n,i,L}B_{i,L}(x) + \psi_{n,i,R} B_{i,R}(x)\right]
		}
		{
			B_{i,L}(x) \sum_{n=1}^N w_n \psi_{n,i,L} + B_{i,R}(x) \sum_{n=1}^N w_n \psi_{n,i,R} 
		} \,. 
	\end{equation}
Here, the LLDG angular flux has been represented as a linear function of the MFEM basis functions. Equation~\ref{mfem:ldconsistent} is a rational polynomial and cannot be integrated analytically. In this case, two point Gauss quadrature was used to numerically perform the MFEM integrations associated with  Eq.~\ref{mfem:ldconsistent}.  The Gauss quadrature points in cell $i$ are given by  
	\begin{equation} 
		x^G_{i,L/R} = \frac{h_i}{2} \mp \frac{x_{i+1/2} + x_{i-1/2}}{2\sqrt{3}} \,,
	\end{equation}
and each quadrature weight is equal to $h/2$.  This method will be referred to as the rational polynomial representation of the Eddington factor. It is clearly a more accurate representation than a constant representation, and thus is expected to generally yield better drift-diffusion solutions for the scalar flux.

The MFEM representation for the scalar flux is constant within a cell, but the LLDG representation for the scalar flux is linear.  This suggests improved 
accuracy \SN solution could be achieved by somehow constructing a linear scalar flux dependence from the MFEM solution.  One simple method for doing 
this is to use the MFEM cell-edge scalar fluxes to compute a slope.  This works quite well, for neutronics.  However, it will be inadequate in a radiative 
transfer calculation because slopes must also be generated for the material temperatures, and an MFEM approximation for the temperatures will not include 
edge temperatures.  We have chosen to use a more generally applicable approach based upon standard data reconstruction techniques 
that require only cell-centered values to compute slopes \cite{vanLeer}.  We also limit such slopes to avoid non-physical scalar fluxes.  For example, the reconstructed left and right scalar fluxes in a cell $i$ are given by 
	\begin{equation} \label{consistent:reconstruction}
		\phi_{i,L/R} = \phi_i \mp \frac{1}{4} \xi_i \left(\Delta \phi_{i+1/2} + \Delta \phi_{i-1/2}\right) \,,
	\end{equation}
where $\xi$ is a van Leer-type slope limiter \cite{vanLeer}:
\begin{equation}
\xi_i = \bracket{
\begin{array} {cl}
0, & \mbox{if  $r_i \le 0$}\,,\\
max\bracet{\frac{r_i}{1+r_i}\,,\frac{1}{1+r_i}}, & \mbox{if $r_i > 0$}\,,
\end{array}
}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
r_i = \frac{\Delta \phi_{i-1/2}}{\Delta \phi_{i+1/2}} \, ,
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\Delta \phi_{i+1/2}=\phi_{i+1}-\phi_{i} \, .
\end{equation}
On the boundaries, we use 
	\begin{subequations}
		\begin{equation}
			\phi_{1,L/R} = \phi_1 \mp \frac{1}{2} \Delta \phi_{3/2} \,,
		\end{equation}
		\begin{equation}
			\phi_{I,L/R} = \phi_I \mp \frac{1}{2} \Delta \phi_{I-1/2} \,.
		\end{equation}
	\end{subequations}
We also set any negative left or right flux values in the boundary cells to zero by appropriately rotating the slopes.
\URL{I'm not sure if this was how the slopes were really calculated, but we need to fully explain what was done, 
and we should do something to prevent negativities from arising.}
