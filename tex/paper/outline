Introduction 
VEF Method
	Analytic description of VEF method 
	LLDG discretized Sn 
	MFEM discretized drift diffusion 
		Eddington representation 
		Boundary conditions 
		scattering reconstruction 
Computational Results
	Order of accuracy 
	diffusion limit 
	solution convergence 
	Comparison to S2SA 
	Convergence rate
Conclusions and Future Work 

switch to not explaining traditional SI
	just explain VEF method (change ell + 1 to ell + 1/2)
